## Description
This project is a sample application to test the policies created by CF template for unauth and auth cognito roles.

This is accomplished by signing in the user using creds from env, and then using the credentials to instantiate IAM client and fetch the role policies for unauth and auth and matching them with the one's stored in constants.
